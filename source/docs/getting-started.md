## Getting Started

WP Headless is a WordPress plugin framework that is designed to make it easier and faster to craft high quality plugins that extend WP GraphQL and allow WordPress to be used as a headless CMS.

Instead of sifting through the WordPress and WP GraphQL docs each time you need to create a custom post type with a few custom fields and a settings page AND making those all queryable via GraphQL so you can pull the data into a static site generator like Gatsby, we have abstracted away WordPress' various API's and simplified working with WP GraphQL so plugins can be configured in hours instead of days and weeks.

Creating such a plugin is as simple as downloading the WP Headless starter plugin, going through the setup process and filling out a few configuration files.

Not all plugins are that simple though. Some require complex fuctionality that can't be achieved with just config files. For these more complex plugins, WP Headless also offers the flexibility to create whatever functionality is needed by tying into the framework's object oriented code base.

Please refer to our [installation](/docs/installation) and [setup guide](/docs/setup) to get started.
